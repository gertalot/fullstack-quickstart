# Development Process Guidelines

- Work iteratively, executing only the steps instructed by the developer.
- For each development task:
  1. Rewrite the task prompt to include all necessary information for flawless execution by an LLM.
  2. Present the rewritten prompt to the developer for feedback.
  3. Incorporate feedback and update the document containing the prompt accordingly.
- All code must be elegant, simple, and free of linter warnings, type errors, or any other errors during development, build, test, and deployment.
- All functionality must be covered by tests, which must pass before a task is considered complete.
- Install all required libraries and frameworks.
- Use git actively:
  - Before starting each development task: `git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME`, with a short branch name that is representative of the task.
  - After completing each development task: Commit all changes for the task to this branch.
  - For successive tasks, branch from the previous task's branch.
- You are encouraged to use all relevant tools (such as `tsc`, `eslint`, and others) to check the codebase for errors or warnings, and to iteratively fix any issues until all checks pass cleanly.
- run tests in the "web" project with `yarn test --run` to disable watch mode
- When a task is complete, request developer sign-off. Once approved, mark the task as done.
- To mark tasks as done, use a markdown checkbox: `[ ]` for incomplete, `[x]` for complete. To mark headings as done, append `(Done)` to the end of the heading. Use either as appropriate.
