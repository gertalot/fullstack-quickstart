# Coding Style Guidelines

- Line length: 120 characters
- Indent: 4 spaces
- Refactor ruthlessly to keep code small, elegant, and readable
- Split code into multiple files or modules of related functionality; use best practice and your expertise for judgement
- Use clear, descriptive, and consistent naming conventions (snake_case for Python, camelCase for JS/TS, PascalCase for classes)
- Always use type annotations (TypeScript types, Python type hints) where possible
- Write concise docstrings (Python) or JSDoc/TSDoc comments (TypeScript) for all public functions, classes, and modules
- Handle errors gracefully and explicitly; avoid bare excepts/catches
- Prefer immutable data structures and avoid mutating function arguments
- All new code must be covered by automated tests
- Minimize external dependencies; use standard libraries when possible
- Use automated formatters (Black, Prettier, etc.) to enforce style
- Write comments only where necessary to explain why, not what
- Remove unused code, variables, and imports promptly
- Follow secure coding practices; never commit secrets or credentials
